# Roadmap: Chrobok.dev

> Derived from `context/foundation/prd.md` (v1) + `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` + an auto-researched codebase baseline.
> Edit-in-place; archive when superseded.
> Slices below are listed in dependency order. The "At a glance" table is the index.

## Vision recap

`chrobok.dev` currently serves a "Work in progress…" page to every recruiter and hiring
manager who follows a link from a CV, LinkedIn, justjoin.it or nofluffjobs — a missing site
would read better than the one that is live. Three years on a single revenue-critical product
left a counted trail (~52 A/B experiments, ~60 locales, an end-to-end payments and
subscription flow) that today exists only inside a CV, so a reader who lands on the site can
see no role, no level, no proof and no way to make contact.

For a frontend craftsman the site *is* the artifact, not a description of one: the page being
well made is the one portfolio signal that copywriting cannot fake. The v1 is seven static
sections — hero, work, skills, about, journal, footer — with no backend, no stored content and
no third-party credentials, so nothing can break silently after release.

## North star

**S-08: A visitor at chrobok.dev sees the complete seven-section page instead of "Work in
progress…"** — the production cutover is the validation milestone because the PRD's primary
success criterion is exactly this, and because the author chose not to expose a half-built page
to recruiters at any point.

> "North star" here means: the smallest end-to-end outcome whose delivery proves the product
> hypothesis — placed as early as its Prerequisites allow, because everything else only matters
> if this lands. In this roadmap the north star sits *last* by deliberate choice: the release is
> a single cutover, so every content slice merges onto an integration branch first and nothing
> reaches production until all seven sections are there. The trade-off is accepted knowingly —
> it costs late feedback in exchange for never showing a recruiter a partial page.

## Streams

Navigation aid — groups items that share a Prerequisites chain. Canonical ordering still lives
in the dependency graph below; this table is the proposed reading order across parallel tracks.

| Stream | Theme            | Chain                                                        | Note                                                                                     |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A      | Content surface  | `F-01` → `S-01` / `S-02` / `S-03` / `S-04` / `S-05` (parallel) → `S-06` | Five section slices fan out once the token contract is settled; nav closes the stream once anchors exist. |
| B      | Ship & inspect   | `F-02` → `F-03` → `S-07` → `S-08`                            | Joins Stream A at `S-06` — the hardening pass needs the full page. Sequenced eagerly because `main_goal: quality`. |

## Baseline

What's already in place in the codebase as of 2026-07-22 (auto-researched + user-confirmed).
Foundations below assume these are present and do NOT re-scaffold them.

- **Frontend:** present — Astro 5.15 + TypeScript + Tailwind 3 + a React 18 island; `src/layouts/Layout.astro`, `src/components/footer/Footer.astro`, and a CVA design-system seed at `src/ui/base/button/`. `src/pages/index.astro` is the "Work in progress…" placeholder this roadmap exists to delete.
- **Backend / API:** absent — no routes and no adapter in `astro.config.mjs` (static output). Deliberate, per PRD §Non-Goals.
- **Data:** absent — no schema, no migrations, no content collections. Deliberate, per PRD §Non-Goals.
- **Auth:** absent — deliberate, per PRD §Access Control (fully public, no accounts).
- **Deploy / infra:** partial — live on Vercel at https://www.chrobok.dev via the Git integration, but `.github/workflows/` is empty and there is no `vercel.json`. Merging to `main` publishes with no gate in front of it.
- **Observability:** absent — deliberate, per PRD §Non-Goals (no analytics, no vendor accounts).
- **Verification / testing:** absent — no test runner and no accessibility or performance check. `yarn build` runs `astro check`, and `eslint` is configured with a flat config. Recorded because all four NFRs are outside-observable properties an inspecting tech lead measures directly.

## Foundations

### F-01: Design-system and layout contract

- **Outcome:** (foundation) the page skeleton and token contract are settled — grid and its mobile collapse, the border-radius scale, the focus-visible ring, and the rule for keeping hard-coded values out — so no content slice has to re-open a visual decision.
- **Change ID:** `design-system-contract`
- **PRD refs:** §Non-Functional Requirements (keyboard reachability, WCAG AA contrast, no layout shift after first paint), §Guardrails ("the site survives a technical inspection")
- **Unlocks:** S-01, S-02, S-03, S-04, S-05 can all be built without re-deciding layout; retires four recorded design risks (shadcn token clash, radius scale leaking through `rounded-md`/`rounded-lg`, hard-coded `border-black` in `Footer.astro`, undefined focus-ring colour); establishes the contrast and focus-state baseline S-07 verifies against.
- **Prerequisites:** —
- **Parallel with:** F-02
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:**
  - Does the 2-column grid hold as the whole page skeleton, or only as a section-level pattern, and at which breakpoint does it collapse? — Owner: author. Block: no.
  - Does Ramaraja 700 against IBM Plex Mono read as craftsmanship or as decoration? Reverting is cheap now and expensive after five sections are built. — Owner: author. Block: no.
  - Is any motion allowed beyond `transition-colors` on hover? — Owner: author. Block: no.
- **Risk:** Sequenced first because `main_goal: quality` and because every content slice inherits these decisions; the failure mode is settling them implicitly inside S-01 and then retro-fitting four other sections.
- **Status:** ready

### F-02: v1 release staging

- **Outcome:** (foundation) v1 work merges and deploys to a preview without touching production — `main` keeps serving the placeholder until the cutover.
- **Change ID:** `v1-release-staging`
- **PRD refs:** §Success Criteria (primary — all seven sections ship together)
- **Unlocks:** S-01 through S-07 can merge and be reviewed on a real URL without exposing a half-built page to a recruiter; this is the mechanism the north star S-08 depends on.
- **Prerequisites:** —
- **Parallel with:** F-01
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:** —
- **Risk:** Without it, the baseline's auto-deploy-on-merge behaviour publishes every partial section straight to chrobok.dev, which contradicts the chosen one-pass release; the risk of the foundation itself is that a long-lived branch drifts, which is bounded by the one-week window.
- **Status:** ready

### F-03: Inspection gate

- **Outcome:** (foundation) every v1 merge is gated on build, type-check and lint, and the inspection checklist behind the NFRs is a repeatable run rather than a memory exercise.
- **Change ID:** `inspection-gate`
- **PRD refs:** §Non-Functional Requirements (all four), §Guardrails ("the site survives a technical inspection")
- **Unlocks:** S-07 has something to run instead of a manual sweep; converts the craftsmanship guardrail from a promise into a check that fails loudly.
- **Prerequisites:** F-02
- **Parallel with:** S-01, S-02, S-03, S-04, S-05
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:**
  - Which checks are automated versus checked by hand — the four-engine matrix in particular may not be worth automating for a static page. — Owner: author. Block: no.
- **Risk:** Sequenced before the hardening pass because `main_goal: quality` says inspection gates are not deferred behind content; the scope risk is that a CI setup grows past the minimum this page needs, which `top_blocker: time` makes expensive.
- **Status:** proposed

## Slices

### S-01: Hero — the first screen

- **Outcome:** Visitor can read the author's name, role title and core stack, read the one-line positioning statement, and reach the email address and the CV — all without scrolling, on a phone as well as on desktop.
- **Change ID:** `hero-first-screen`
- **PRD refs:** US-01, FR-001, FR-002, FR-003
- **Prerequisites:** F-01, F-02
- **Parallel with:** S-02, S-03, S-04, S-05, F-03
- **Blockers:** The CV link's target artifact does not exist yet (PRD Open Question 3) — the link can be wired to its final path, but the file arrives from outside this repository.
- **Unknowns:**
  - Does the positioning line use the author's own AI formulation verbatim, or a shortened variant that still avoids reading as "I don't use AI"? — Owner: author. Block: no.
- **Risk:** This screen carries the acceptance criteria of the only user story, so its failure mode is silent — it can look finished while missing one of the four things a recruiter needs; note that FR-001's resolution deliberately leaves seniority *out* of the hero, which makes S-02 load-bearing for it.
- **Status:** proposed

### S-02: Work — the proof block

- **Outcome:** Visitor can read the commercial work as a single block dominated by the Rentola role, including the ownership scope that signals seniority, the outcome-based numbers, and stack tags split into core and supporting tiers.
- **Change ID:** `work-proof-block`
- **PRD refs:** US-01, FR-004, FR-005, FR-006
- **Prerequisites:** F-01, F-02
- **Parallel with:** S-01, S-03, S-04, S-05, F-03
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:**
  - Which of the four candidate numbers (A/B experiments, locales, SEO migrations, payments flow) make the cut, given that the PR count was removed as an activity metric? — Owner: author. Block: no.
- **Risk:** The single place on the page where level is calibrated — if the ownership scope is not explicit here, nothing on the page states seniority and the reader guesses downward; the opposite failure is overstating, which collides with the no-overstated-competencies guardrail.
- **Status:** proposed

### S-03: Skills — two honest tiers

- **Outcome:** Visitor can scan a grouped technology list split into a core tier and a supporting tier, with no ratings, levels, bars or percentages.
- **Change ID:** `skills-two-tier`
- **PRD refs:** FR-007
- **Prerequisites:** F-01, F-02
- **Parallel with:** S-01, S-02, S-04, S-05, F-03
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:** —
- **Risk:** The tier split is the mechanism that keeps SQL, Node.js and Rails from reading as strongly as React; collapsing it back to one flat list would quietly break the no-overstatement guardrail that the site, the CV and GitHub must jointly satisfy.
- **Status:** proposed

### S-04: About and journal

- **Outcome:** Visitor can read a short bio paragraph that includes the decade of teaching in one sentence, and can open the developer's journal on Instagram from a labelled link.
- **Change ID:** `about-and-journal`
- **PRD refs:** FR-008, FR-009
- **Prerequisites:** F-01, F-02
- **Parallel with:** S-01, S-02, S-03, S-05, F-03
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:** —
- **Risk:** Two adjacent, low-weight sections combined so neither becomes a one-line slice; the risk is length discipline — a long About pushes the proof further down the page.
- **Status:** proposed

### S-05: Footer contact

- **Outcome:** Visitor can select the email address as text and open the LinkedIn profile, the GitHub profile and the CV PDF — the last as a direct, ungated download.
- **Change ID:** `footer-contact`
- **PRD refs:** FR-010, FR-011
- **Prerequisites:** F-01, F-02
- **Parallel with:** S-01, S-02, S-03, S-04, F-03
- **Blockers:** The CV PDF is produced outside this repository (PRD Open Question 3, "prepare resume"). Owner: author.
- **Unknowns:**
  - What is the CV's public path and filename, so both this slice and S-01 link to the same target? — Owner: author. Block: no.
- **Risk:** Together with S-01 this satisfies the success criterion that a contact channel is reachable from both the top and the bottom of the page; the external CV artifact means the slice can be fully built and still not be releasable.
- **Status:** proposed

### S-06: Sticky section navigation

- **Outcome:** Visitor can jump to any of the seven sections from a sticky header, on every breakpoint.
- **Change ID:** `sticky-section-nav`
- **PRD refs:** FR-012
- **Prerequisites:** S-01, S-02, S-03, S-04, S-05
- **Parallel with:** —
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:** —
- **Risk:** Sequenced last among content slices because it needs every section anchor to exist; the accepted trade-off recorded in FR-012 is that a sticky header eats first-screen area on mobile, which is exactly where the recruiter opens the pasted link — worth re-checking against S-01 once both are on the preview.
- **Status:** proposed

### S-07: Inspection hardening pass

- **Outcome:** Visitor can reach every piece of content and every link by keyboard alone and with a screen reader, still gets all information and links with scripts disabled, sees text meeting WCAG AA contrast, and reads the page in under a second on a phone with no layout shift after first paint.
- **Change ID:** `inspection-hardening-pass`
- **PRD refs:** US-01 (mobile viewport acceptance criterion), §Non-Functional Requirements (all four)
- **Prerequisites:** F-03, S-06
- **Parallel with:** —
- **Blockers:** —
- **Unknowns:**
  - Which browser/engine combinations get a real manual check versus a reasoned assumption? — Owner: author. Block: no.
- **Risk:** This is where the craftsmanship claim is either paid or refuted — a site that fails inspection damages the positioning harder than any copy supports it; the competing risk is that a `quality` bias turns this into open-ended polishing against a one-week window.
- **Status:** proposed

### S-08: v1 production cutover

- **Outcome:** Visitor arriving at chrobok.dev from a pasted link sees the complete seven-section page, with no "Work in progress" or placeholder content anywhere on it.
- **Change ID:** `v1-production-cutover`
- **PRD refs:** US-01, §Success Criteria (primary — both criteria close here)
- **Prerequisites:** S-07
- **Parallel with:** —
- **Blockers:** The CV PDF must exist at its public path before release (PRD Open Question 3). Owner: author.
- **Unknowns:**
  - Is the CV PDF final and published at the path S-01 and S-05 link to? — Owner: author. Block: yes.
- **Risk:** The north star, and the only slice that changes what a recruiter actually sees; releasing it with a dead CV link would break FR-011 on the exact path the site exists to shorten, which is why the unknown above blocks rather than warns.
- **Status:** blocked

## Open Roadmap Questions

1. **Availability is deliberately absent from the site.** Market research for PL/EU remote hiring ranks availability, contract form (B2B vs UoP) and timezone as high-value, low-cost elements that pre-qualify a screening call; the author has ruled all of it out as out-of-place in a portfolio. Owner: author. Block: none — revisit only if inbound arrives with repeated questions about terms.
2. **Open Graph / link-preview metadata was declined for v1.** It acts *before* anyone clicks, and the site's whole distribution model is a link pasted by hand into recruiter chats and job-board profiles, so the preview currently renders empty. Cost is a few meta tags and one image. Owner: author. Block: none — would attach to S-01 if reopened.
3. **The CV PDF does not yet exist.** FR-011 depends on an artifact produced outside this repository ("prepare resume"). Owner: author. Block: S-08 (and the release readiness of S-01 and S-05).
4. **Single content source of truth for page + CV** — declined for the MVP window, but it is the only mechanism that would make the "site, CV and GitHub must agree" guardrail self-enforcing rather than manually maintained. Owner: author. Block: none — expansion phase.
5. **`author-profile.md:138` is stale.** It records "Hosting and domain wiring for chrobok.dev — currently nothing is deployed", but a placeholder page is live at https://www.chrobok.dev. Owner: author. Block: none — fix on the next edit of that document.

## Parked

- **Internationalisation and a Polish version** — Why parked: PRD §Non-Goals. The funnel is English and English is what remote employers screen for; the i18n proof point belongs in the Work section, not in this site's build.
- **Stored content, a content-management surface, an admin panel** — Why parked: PRD §Non-Goals. Seven sections of static content have nothing to store, and this is the single most likely place for a one-week build to become a one-month build.
- **Per-project case-study subpages and an on-site blog** — Why parked: PRD §Non-Goals. The most expensive option considered, and a handful of stale posts is a worse signal than no blog at all.
- **Contact form, newsletter, analytics** — Why parked: PRD §Non-Goals. Anything needing a submission target, a cookie-consent flow or a third-party account keeps the MVP above zero moving parts.
- **Open Graph / link-preview metadata and image** — Why parked: PRD Open Question 2, declined for v1 by the author. Recorded here because `top_blocker: time` makes it a natural first re-entry once v1 is live.
- **Dark mode** — Why parked: `design-notes.md` records it as out of scope; `darkMode: ['class']` is Tailwind scaffold, not a requirement.
- **Deriving the page and the CV PDF from one content source** — Why parked: PRD §Business Logic, declined for the MVP window; leading candidate for the expansion phase.
